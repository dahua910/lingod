git config --list



出现的问题
1	 git pull
	You asked me to pull without telling me which branch you
	want to merge with, and 'branch.master.merge' in
	your configuration file does not tell me either.  Please
	name which branch you want to merge on the command line and
	try again (e.g. 'git pull <repository> <refspec>').
	See git-pull(1) for details on the refspec.

	If you often merge with the same branch, you may want to
	configure the following variables in your configuration
	file:

	    branch.master.remote = <nickname>
	    branch.master.merge = <remote-ref>
	    remote.<nickname>.url = <url>
	    remote.<nickname>.fetch = <refspec>

	See git-config(1) for details.

1	把现有的branch删除，重新建立过
